The Arctic Ice cap is, in a sense, of the beating heart of the global climate system. It expands in winter and contracts in summer. In the last five years, we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours, 25 million tons every day to the oceans. The Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns. This one of them is part of one of the campaigns. The positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge. There's an old African proverb that says: if you want to go quickly, go alone. We need to go far quickly.
