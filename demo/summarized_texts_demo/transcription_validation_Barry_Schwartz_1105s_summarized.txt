The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice. The more choice people have, the more freedom they have. We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones.

We don't inherit an identity, we get to invent it and we re-invent ourselves as often as we. Every day when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what person you want to be With respect to marriage and family. We are blessed with the technology that enables us to work Every minute of every day. When there are lots of alternatives to consider, it is easy to imagine The attractive features of alternatives that you reject, that make it you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen. The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose. Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose. Steve Levitt: With all of these options available, my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be gone up. He says the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. Levitt says the secret to happiness is low expectations. If some of what enables people in our societies to make all the choices we make, we're shifted to societies in which people have too few options. This is what economists call a Pareto Improving Move. Income redistribution will make everyone better off, not just poor people, because of how all this excess choice plays us.
