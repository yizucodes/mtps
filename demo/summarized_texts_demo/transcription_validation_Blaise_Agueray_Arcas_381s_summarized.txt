Microsoft has created an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data. This is an entire book. Every column is a chapter, and to prove to you that it's really text and not an image, we can do something to really show that this is a real representation. Microsoft's new tool allows users to create virtual models of the entire Earth. Images are linked to each other based on the content inside the images. This is the long tail to Stephen Lawler's virtual Earth work, and this is something that grows in complexity as people use it.
